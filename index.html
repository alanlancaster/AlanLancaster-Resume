        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administration Student</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I have always desired to be unique, and take advantage of the multiple opportunities presented before me, trying to be involved in as many activities that I could undertake, which varied from taking advanced placement classes or to participating in sports. Throughout my high school years, I took a total of 12 AP and honors classes, all in which helped me challenge myself and expand my overall knowledge. In high school I was also the president of UNICEF club, and vice president of science club, taking the opportunity to run and manage these clubs. I spent several months on end dedicating my time to practice golf and to focus on improving overall as an athlete. I was able to win a championship with my team, going undefeated. My position on the golf team in high school has given me the opportunity to assimilate the responsibilities that had to be taken in order to have success as a team and as an individual.<br><br>

        As far as professional experience, I have only volunteered at a community hospital in my hometown for nine months. While spending my time there, I had the opportunity to help with various tasks and patients. This invaluable opportunity allowed me to give back to my community and help others. Regarding more leadership experiences, I had also joined the Academic Decathlon team when I first started high school and participated for four years. Being in Academic Decathlon has taught me to become determined while studying several subjects and learning new material, while being proficient in speech and test taking. Throughout my four years of Academic Decathlon, I took the position of team captain and president, upholding the responsibilities and qualities of a team leader. Being in Academic Decathlon for four years has allowed me to uphold the characteristics of being highly committed and determined with tasks at hand.<br><br>

        Additionally, I also developed a passion for weight lifting. Weight lifting has helped change my physical structure, strength, and improved my health tremendously throughout a couple of years. Additionally, I have always believed weight lifting and working out has helped me maintain a positive and successful mindset. In my junior year of high school, I had also become interested in track and field, especially in the field area, which required technique and the attribute of strength. Naturally, I am a shorter person in height, and was told having a larger size gives advantages to those in their performance. Having the possibility of a slight disadvantage, I was told by several people that I should not compete in shot put and discus due to my size and composition; regardless, I decided to train and join the team. Throughout the season, I spent time studying techniques and constantly training in order to improve, which allowed me to compete on the varsity team. Even though several people discouraged me to pursue my interest, I made my own decision and committed to it. This part in my life taught me a valuable lesson of pursuing my passions or interests regardless of what others say.
